<p align="center"><b>Boundary time</b></p>

<p>This option (if configured by an administrator) allows you to set
   a boundary time (in minutes) for the meeting.</p>

<p>This boundary time allows users to access the meeting before it's
   specified start time in order to properly configure their audio
   settings and make sure they have the necessary software installed.</p>

<p>If you cannot select a value for this time that means an administrator
   has chosen a default time for all meetings.</p>
