<p align="center"><b>Reserved seats</b></p>

<p>This option allows you to reserve a set number of seats for your
    meeting.</p>

<p>If you reserve seats for your meeting, it means that you will
   always have that number of spaces available for people to join
   in.  Another meeting scheduled during the same time period can
   not take away any of your reserved seats.</p>

<p>You should enter a value and use the <b>Check availability</b>
   link to see if the number of seats you want to reserve is
   available for the duration of your meeting.  If not, you will
   be told what the maximum number of seats available to you is.</p>
